# In a prospective study of 107 hospitalized patients, decrease of IgG rates and serological assays becoming 
# negative did not imply loss of neutralizing capacity. Our results indicate a sustained humoral response against the 
# ancestral strain and the D614G, B.1.1.7 and P.1 variants for at least 6 months (last of two samples taken) 
# in patients previously hospitalized for COVID-19. A weaker protection was however observed for the B.1.351 variant.

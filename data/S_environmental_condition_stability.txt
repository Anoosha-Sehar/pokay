# No differences in the stability of B.1.1.7 observed in the absence of simulated sunlight at either 20°C or 40°C (with a mean time for 
# a 90% loss of viral infectivity across all dark conditions of 6.2 hours). However, a small but statistically 
# significant difference in the stability was observed in simulated sunlight at 20°C and 20% relative humidity, with B.1.1.7 restoring 
# wild type 90% loss time of 11 minutes vs. 7 and 8 minutes for B.1.319 (D614G) and B.28 (V367F) early 2020 viruses respectively.

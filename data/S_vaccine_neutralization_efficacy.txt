# The neutralizing activity of vaccine was significantly lower against B.1.351 (12.4x in twelve Moderna-recipient sera; 10.3x in ten Pfizer-recipient sera).
# PG: this is a larger list of B.1.351 than modeled by Wang et al. (2021) by including L18F and R246I, and is less effective at neutralizing.

# The neutralizing activity of vaccine was slightly to significantly lower against this variant combination in sera from all 24 patients with 
# the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. (Fig. 4)
# PG: This is in stark contrast to this combination plus K417N, which had no effect (P<0.0001 vs. P=0.8774).
# Chen et al. (2021) https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01294-w
# In 20 sera from BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine inoculated participants, 6 displayed mild (2x) reductions in neutralization.
# This variant combination showed the highest reduction, but the magnitude of the differences was small 
# compared to the >4x differences in HA-inhibition titers that have been used to signal potential need for a strain change in influenza vaccines.

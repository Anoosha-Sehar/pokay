# Wildtype elicits immune response, COVID-19 cohort epitope score > 99th percentile of the 497 pre-pandemic controls, mutant drops PIWAS epitope score from 1% to 0.17% (poorer immune recognition)
# Together with other B1.1.7 lineage mutational changes (Spike: N501Y, A570D, P681H, Nucleoprotein: D3L, S235F) resulted in only 2 of 579 individuals (0.3% of the population) having a dramatic reduction in PIWAS antigen scores, which reflects the peak epitope signal along the entire antigen.

# Wildtype elicits immune response, COVID-19 cohort epitope score > 99th percentile of the 497 pre-pandemic controls, mutant drops PIWAS epitope score from 3% to 1.2% (poorer immune recognition)
# Together with other B1.1.7 lineage mutational changes (Spike: Y144del, A570D, P681H, Nucleoprotein: D3L, S235F) resulted in only 2 or 579 individuals (0.3% of the population) having a dramatic reduction in PIWAS antigen scores, which reflects the peak epitope signal along the entire antigen.

# Wildtype elicits immune response, COVID-19 cohort epitope score > 99th percentile of the 497 pre-pandemic controls, mutant raises PIWAS epitope score from 3.6% to 6.2% (improved immune recognition)
# Together with other B1.1.7 lineage mutational changes (Spike: Y144del,N501Y, P681H, Nucleoprotein: D3L, S235F) resulted in only 2 of 579 individuals (0.3% of the population) having a dramatic reduction in PIWAS antigen scores, which reflects the peak epitope signal along the entire antigen.

A570D

# Wildtype elicits immune response, COVID-19 cohort epitope score > 99th percentile of the 497 pre-pandemic controls, mutant drops PIWAS epitope score from 7.8% to 1.2% (significantly poorer immune recognition)
# Together with other B1.1.7 lineage mutational changes (Spike: Y144del,N501Y, A570D Nucleoprotein: D3L, S235F) resulted in only 2 of 579 individuals (0.3% of the population) having a dramatic reduction in PIWAS antigen scores, which reflects the peak epitope signal along the entire antigen.

# This variant is adjacent to the Spike protein furin cleavage site (cleavage of S into S1 and S2 subunits is required for viral membrane fusion and subsequent entry into host cells), a site shown to be highly immunogenic.

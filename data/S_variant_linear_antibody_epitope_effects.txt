# Epitope score > 99th percentile of the 497 pre-pandemic controls
# Together with other B.1.1.7 lineage mutational changes (Spike: N501Y, A570D, P681H, Nucleoprotein: D3L, S235F) resulted in only 2 of 579 individuals (0.3% of the population) having a dramatic reduction in PIWAS antigen scores, which reflects the peak epitope signal along the entire antigen.

# Using molecular dynamic simulation, the mildly (~1kcal/mol) enhanced binding energy of this variant is primarily 
# contributed by Tyr505 (âˆ’4.98 kcal/mol) which is now involved in a strong hydrogen bonding network with Arg393. 
# Another important energetic contribution comes from the altered orientation of Tyr41 which is now involved with 
# two hydrogen-bonding interactions with Asp355 and Thr500.

# Studying the key covariants in lineage of concern 501Y.V2, 
# observed about 2-fold increase in ACE2 binding vs wildtype, but greatly decreased mAb binding, suggesting evolutionary optimum tension between

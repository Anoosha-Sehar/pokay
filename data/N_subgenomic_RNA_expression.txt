# A noncanonical subgenomic RNA which could represent ORF9b is significantly enriched (~16x) in B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 infections, 
# potentially as a result of a triple nucleotide mutation leading to amino acid substitution D3L 
# in nucleocapsid in this lineage which increases complementarity with the genomic leader sequence.

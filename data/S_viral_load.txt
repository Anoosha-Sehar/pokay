# In a study of 1260 ICU subjects, viral load distributions (collected within 48h of admission) were elevated in 
# both seropositive and seronegative subjects infected with B.1.1.7 ("UK variant"). 
# PG: The PANGO tool defining Spike variants for B.1.1.17 are listed here, whereas the paper only used a test for D1118H.

# Hamsters infected with SARS-CoV-2 expressing spike(D614G) (G614 virus) produced higher infectious titres in nasal washes and the trachea, but not in the lungs, 
# supporting clinical evidence showing that the mutation enhances viral loads in the upper respiratory tract of COVID-19 patients and may increase transmission.

# We estimated that in swab samples N/NP viral RNA is approximately 2-fold higher in B.1.427/B.1.429 than in non-variant viruses.

# Mutation is predicted to lose the T cell epitope for people carrying DRB1*0301 and DRB1*0401, 
# but not for example in those who are DRB1*0701 or DRB1*1501 who would be predicted to show an enhanced response.
# This is also observed in a study of 26 each post-infection and post first dose HCWs.

# Analyzing responses to the E484K mutation seen in B.1.351 and P.1 variants, we noted that it did 
# not fall in a region predicted to bind the HLAII alleles tested (table S4). The mutation appeared 
# to have no substantial or differential impact on T cell responses.

# Vaccinated, but not post-infection sera, show decreased average T cell response to an N501Y peptide.
# When we primed transgenic mice expressing human HLA-DRB1*0401 with the Wuhan Hu-1 peptide pool, 
# T cell responses to the B.1.1.7 variant peptide pool were significantly reduced (p = 0.0286). 
# Furthermore, the T cell response to the spike N501Y mutation common to all three of the current VOC was ablated.

# PBMCs of 11 mild COVID-19 patients collected 38-80 days after symptom onset
# were stimulated with the 15-mer peptide pools (w/ 10 residue overlaps) from the wholle viral proteome, 
# showing no significant CD4+ cell count effect for P.1, 
# and a slight increase in CD8+ percentage (p=0.0195) by Activation Induced Marker (AIM) assay (cellular immunity measurement). 
# [in the text, this increase is not noted as signficant, even though p=0.05 is used elsewhere in the text as a signficance threshold]

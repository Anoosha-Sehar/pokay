# The induction level of IFN-γ expression by the Y453F derivative in two different A*24:02 convalescent sera 
# donor plasma (linear epitope NYNYLYRLF 448,456) was signficantly lower.

# L452R derivative virus did not induce IFN-γ expression even at the highest concentration tested (10 nM) in two different A*24:02 convalescent sera 
# donor plasma (linear epitope NYNYLYRLF 448,456).

# Mutation is predicted to lose the T cell epitope for people carrying DRB1*0301 and DRB1*0401, 
# but not for example in those who are DRB1*0701 or DRB1*1501 who would be predicted to show an enhanced response.
# This is also observed in a study of 26 each post-infection and post first dose HCWs.

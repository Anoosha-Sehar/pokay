# NSP6 part of the lineage defining variants for B.1.1.7 in PANGO.
# This lineage is associate with higher viral load in a study of 1260 ICU patients. 
# It is not clear whether the hoigher load is due to reduced virus clearance, increased virion production, or both.
# This variant is found in other Variants of Concern.
# PG: This variant flanks an endoplasmic reticulum lumenal binding domain, possibly implicating increased virion 
# production through better recruitment of SARS-CoV-2 replication machinery assembly in the lumen.

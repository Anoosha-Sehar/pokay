# Danish study of the B.1.1.7 lineage shows hospital admission odds ratio of 1.63 vs other lineages. The adjusted OR was increased in all strata of age.

# On average across 7 European countries studied, using B.1.1.7 defining mutations:
# Significant shift to asymptomatic cases (27.4% vs 18.6% for non-VOC cases). 
# Significant shift to infection in those without pre-existing conditions (44.8% vs 89% for non-VOC cases).
# Significant increase in hospitalization rate (11% vs 7.5% for non-VOC cases).
# Significant increase in ICU rate (1.4% vs 0.6% for non-VOC cases).
# Significant decrease in death rate (2.0% vs vs 4.0% for non-VOC cases).

# The matching-adjusted conditional odds ratio of hospitalisation was 1.58 (95% confidence interval 1.50 to 1.67) for COVID-19 patients 
# infected with a SGTF-associated variant [primarily B.1.1.7], compared to those infected with non-SGTF-associated variants. 
# The effect was modified by age (p<0.001), with ORs of 0.96-1.13 below age 20 years and 1.57-1.67 in age groups 40 years or older.

# In the Southern Brazilian stats of Rio Grande do Sul, comparing pre-P.1 and post-P.1 waves: 
# The increase in Case Falaity Rate occurred in a greatest intensity in the population between 20 and 59 years old and among patients
# without pre-existing risk conditions. Female 20 to 39 years old, with no pre-existing risk conditions, were
# at risk of death 5.65 times higher in February (95%CI = 2.9 - 11.03; p <0.0001) and in the age group of
# 40 and 59 years old, this risk was 7.7 times higher (95%CI = 5.01-11.83; p <0.0001) comparing with
# November-December. This maybe due to a combination of changes in pathogenicity and virulence profiles, and health system overload.

# In the Paran state of Brazil, patients aged 20-29 years experienced a tripling of their case fatality rate (CFR), from 0.04% to 0.13%, while those aged 
# 30-39, 40-49, 50-59 experienced approximate CFR doubling comparing February to January in 2021. Notably, 
# the observed CFR increase coincided with the second consecutive month of declining number of diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 cases. 
# Taken together, these preliminary findings suggest significant increases in CFR in young and middle-aged adults after 
# identification of a novel SARS-CoV-2 strain circulating in Brazil. 
# PG: this is somewhat indirect evidence that assume greatly increasing proportion of P.1 cases in March (70%) compared to 
# February, but the first official ID of P.1 in Parana state (Feb 16th) may be due to testing procedures rather than actual prevalence?

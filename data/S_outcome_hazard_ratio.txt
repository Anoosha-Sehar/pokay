# Danish study of the B.1.1.7 lineage shows hospital admission odds ratio of 1.63 vs other lineages. The adjusted OR was increased in all strata of age.

# In the Southern Brazilian stats of Rio Grande do Sul, comparing pre-P.1 and post-P.1 waves: 
# The increase in Case Falaity Rate occurred in a greatest intensity in the population between 20 and 59 years old and among patients
# without pre-existing risk conditions. Female 20 to 39 years old, with no pre-existing risk conditions, were
# at risk of death 5.65 times higher in February (95%CI = 2.9 - 11.03; p <0.0001) and in the age group of
# 40 and 59 years old, this risk was 7.7 times higher (95%CI = 5.01-11.83; p <0.0001) comparing with
# November-December. This maybe due to a combination of changes in pathogenicity and virulence profiles, and health system overload.

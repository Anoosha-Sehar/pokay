# No biochemical data, but high quality non-synonymous homoplasies from a paper, where functional fitness is presumed.

# PG: Effect is synonymous (N824=), with the reference contig containing the optimal human codon (AAC) vs this variant (AAU).
# PG: Has not lead to major lineage expansions, but is in an accessible unpaired break in a preicted RNA structure. 
# PG: The homoplasy may be due to propensity of this site to deamination rather than a fitness advantage,
# PG: or the fitness advantage is quite small. The residue immediately follows the initial helix domain of the Spike
# PG: fusion peptide, so the varioant's suboptimal codon usage *could* possibly facilitate translation stall to improve protein confirmation 
# PG: with downstream beta sheet.

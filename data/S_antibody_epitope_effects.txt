# The neutralization titer of NTD-binding mAb159 was 133-fold reduced on P.1 compared to Victoria (~wild type), with only 64% neutralization at 10 μg/mL. 
# Residues 20, 18, and 138 form a cluster underlying the 245–259 loop, which inserts into a groove between the light and heavy chains of Fab 159. In addition,
# the N-terminal residues preceding residue 18 interact with the antibody and may be perturbed. It is also conceivable that the failure of this antibody to
# achieve complete neutralization could be due to partial glycosylation at residue 20, which is some 16 Å from bound Fab 159. 
# Since it has been proposed that there is a single supersite for potent NTD-binding antibodies, we would expect the binding of many of these to be affected.

# Lowered	the	neutralization potency of mAb COVA1-12 to the	limit	of the assay.
# Decrease in potency	was	observed against the N501Y pseudotype	for the cluster IX mAb COVA2-17.

N501Y

# Wildtype elicits immune response, COVID-19 cohort epitope score > 99th percentile of the 497 pre-pandemic controls, mutant raises PIWAS epitope score from 3.6% to 6.2% (improved immune recognition)
# Together with other B1.1.7 lineage mutational changes (Spike: Y144del,N501Y, P681H, Nucleoprotein: D3L, S235F) resulted in only 2 of 579 individuals (0.3% of the population) having a dramatic reduction in PIWAS antigen scores, which reflects the peak epitope signal along the entire antigen.

# Wildtype elicits immune response, COVID-19 cohort epitope score > 99th percentile of the 497 pre-pandemic controls, mutant drops PIWAS epitope score from 7.8% to 1.2% (significantly poorer immune recognition)
# Together with other B1.1.7 lineage mutational changes (Spike: Y144del,N501Y, A570D Nucleoprotein: D3L, S235F) resulted in only 2 of 579 individuals (0.3% of the population) having a dramatic reduction in PIWAS antigen scores, which reflects the peak epitope signal along the entire antigen.

# This variant is adjacent to the Spike protein furin cleavage site (cleavage of S into S1 and S2 subunits is required for viral membrane fusion and subsequent entry into host cells), a site shown to be highly immunogenic.

# We estimate that this [B1.1.17] variant has a 43–90% (range of 95% credible intervals 38–130%) higher reproduction number than preexisting variants.
# Data from other countries yield similar results: we estimate that R for VOC 202012/01 relative to other lineages is 55% (45–66%) higher in Denmark, 
# 74% (66–82%) higher in Switzerland, and 59% (56–63%) higher in the United States, with consistent rates of displacement across regions within each country.

# Primary cases infected with B.1.1.7 had an increased transmissibility of 1.5-1.7 times that of primary cases infected with other 
# lineages. The increased transmissibility of B.1.1.7 was multiplicative across age and viral load.

# At the national level (Italy), we estimated a mean relative transmissibility of B.1.1.7 (compared to historical lineages) ranging 
# between 1.55 and 1.57 (with confidence intervals between 1.45 and 1.66).

# The relative transmissibility of P.1 estimated at the national level (Italy) varied according to the assumed 
# degree of cross-protection granted by infection with other lineages and ranged from 1.12 (95%CI 1.03-1.23) in the 
# case of complete immune evasion by P.1 to 1.39 (95%CI 1.26-1.56) in the case of complete cross-protection.
# PG: variant list has been abbreviated due to mixed K417 bases in this lineage, potential miscalls of deletions

# Assuming complete cross-protection, we estimate 501Y.V2/B1.351 was 1.50 (95% CrI: 1.20-2.13)
# times as transmissible than previously circulating variants. Assuming instead that 501Y.V2 is
# identically transmissible, the new variant evades 21% (95% CrI: 11-36%) of previously
# acquired immunity. Reality may lie between these extremes, with an intermediate increase in
# transmissibility and mildly imperfect cross-protection from past exposure.

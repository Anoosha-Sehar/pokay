# We estimate that this [B1.1.17] variant has a 43–90% (range of 95% credible intervals 38–130%) higher reproduction number than preexisting variants.
# Data from other countries yield similar results: we estimate that R for VOC 202012/01 relative to other lineages is 55% (45–66%) higher in Denmark, 
# 74% (66–82%) higher in Switzerland, and 59% (56–63%) higher in the United States, with consistent rates of displacement across regions within each country.

# No biochemical data, but high quality non-synonymous homoplasies from a paper, where functional fitness is presumed.

# PG: All four bases observed in this 2nd codon position, leading to different non-synonymous AA changes 
# PG: Other changes within this codon (non-homoplasic) have been observed also.
# PG: Has not lead to major lineage expansions, nor is it critical to a well defined RNA secondary structure. 
# PG: This site may have a propensity for poor exonucleae repair or poor ref AA fitness, rather than a clear fitness advantage of the variants.
# PG: This variant also encodes changes to ORF9b (mitochondria-and-TOM70-associating IFN-I response suppressor), in the first codon position.

# PG: Effect is synonymous (Y360=), with the variant containing the optimal human codon (UAU) vs the reference (UAC).
# PG: Has not lead to major lineage expansions, and is in unpaired regions of predicted RNA secondary structure. 
# PG: Presumably the homoplasy is due to propensity of this site to deamination rather than a clear fitness advantage, 
# though codon optimization may be slightly useful as this position is towards the C terminus.

# Remdesivir failure with SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase mutation in a B-cell immunodeficient patient with protracted Covid-19
# We report the occurrence of a mutation in the RdRP (D484Y) following failure of remdesivir in a 76-year-old woman with a post-rituximab B-cell immunodeficiency and persistent SARSCoV
-2 viremia.

# V557L mutation is implicated in low-level resistance to Remdesivir.

# S861G mutation in RdRp eliminates chain-termination by Remdesivir, which confirms the existence of a steric clash between S861 and the incorporated RDV-TP

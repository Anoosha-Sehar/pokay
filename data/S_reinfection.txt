# Hamsters re-infected with B.1.351 virus after seroversion from previous infection with a lineage A virus did not transmit 
# virus to naive sentinels via direct contact transmission, in contrast to the non-seroconverted animals. They had little 
# infectious virus and no pathology in the lungs.
# Initial infection with SARS-CoV-2 lineage A does not prevent heterologous reinfection with B.1.351, but prevents disease and onward transmission.

# Hamsters re-infected with B.1.351 virus after seroversion from previous infection with a lineage A virus did not transmit 
# virus to naive sentinels via direct contact transmission, in contrast to the non-seroconverted animals. They had little 
# infectious virus and no pathology in the lungs.
# Initial infection with SARS-CoV-2 lineage A does not prevent heterologous reinfection with B.1.351, but prevents disease and onward transmission.

# Reinfection with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) B.1.1.7 variant in an immunocompromised 16yo female with end stage renal disease
# 94 days after initial infection with a B.1.2 lineage virus. Both lineages were the prevalent one at the time of 1st and 2nd infections respectively in Texas,
# where the patient was located (suggesting exposure risk rather than lineage immune evasion).

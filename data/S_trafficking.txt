# We report here pseudoviruses carrying SG614 enter ACE2-expressing cells more efficiently than wild type (~9-fold).

# D614G does not alter S-protein binding to ACE2 or neutralization sensitivity of pseudoviruses. Thus, D614G may 
# increase infectivity by assembling more functional S protein into the virion.

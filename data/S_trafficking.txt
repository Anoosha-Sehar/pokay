# This mutation in the first base of the furin clevage site maintains the RXXR recognition motif, and is presumed to enhance

# While the introduction of P681H in the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant may increase spike cleavage by furin-like proteases, 
# this does not significantly impact viral entry or cell-cell spread. We consider that other factors are at play to account 
# for the increased in transmission and disease severity attributed to this variant of concern (VOC).

# In a 1:5 test-negative matched control study of 8153 individuals who received the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine, 2027 test-positive cases were Delta.
# Two dose vaccine efficacy against Delta decreased from 94.1% (90.5-96.3%) 14-60 days after vaccination to 80.0% 
# (70.2-86.6%) 151-180 days after vaccination. Waning was less pronounced for non-Delta variants. VE against Delta 
# was lower among individuals aged â‰¥65 years (75.2% [59.6-84.8%]) than those aged 18-64 years (87.9% [85.5-89.9%]). 
# VE against Delta hospitalization was 97.6% (92.8-99.2%). One-dose VE was 77.0% (60.7-86.5%) against Delta infection.

# In Minnesota in July 2020 (when Delta variant prevalence was >70%), the effectiveness against infection for mRNA-1273 was estimated at 76% 
# (95% CI: 58-87%) using age, sex, race, PCR testing and vaccination date matched cohorts of unvaccinated, Pfizer and Moderna vaccinees. 
# An even more pronounced reduction in effectiveness was observed for BNT162b2 of 42% (95% CI: 13-62%). 
# mRNA-1273 conferred a two-fold risk reduction against breakthrough infection compared to BNT162b2 (IRR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.39-0.64).
# In Florida, which is currently experiencing its largest COVID-19 surge to date, the risk of infection in July after full vaccination 
# with mRNA-1273 was about 60% lower than after full vaccination with BNT162b2 (IRR: 0.39, 95% CI: 0.24-0.62).

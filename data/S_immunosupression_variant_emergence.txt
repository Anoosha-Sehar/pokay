# Combination of RBD mutations appeared (day 75) and persisted in chronic (152 day) SARS-CoV-2 infection of immunoicompromised patient with severe antiphospholipid syndrome
# complicated by diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, who was receiving anticoagulation therapy, glucocorticoids, cyclophosphamide, and intermittent rituximab and eculizumab.

# Appeared (day 75) and persisted in chronic (152 day) SARS-CoV-2 infection of immunoicompromised patient with severe antiphospholipid syndrome
# Appeared at same time as T478K,S494P but listed separately due to distance and different domains affected in the Spike (i.e. putatively an independent
# mutation from a functional standpoint since the former are from S1, the latter from S2).

# The delH69/V70 enhances viral infectivity, indicating its effect on virus fitness is independent to the N501Y RBM change [with which it is found in lineage B.1.1.7]
# Possibly arisen as a result of the virus evolving from immune selection pressure in infected individuals and possibly only one chronic infection in the case of lineage B.1.1.7.
